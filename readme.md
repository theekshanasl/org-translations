## Translation guidelines

* All translation need to start from the english translation.  
  It is the base and will always be used as a fallback for missing translations
* Some translation strings contain ```%s``` or ```%d```, These will be replaced with a string or a number before being placed on the web page  
  The content of the ```%s``` or ```%d``` will be metioned in a comment in the translation file  
* **elementary os** is always spelled with a lowercase e. No matter if it's at the start of a sentence
